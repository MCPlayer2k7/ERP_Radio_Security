Moderation Panel
	- Staff Status information label changed to display Protection Status from the new protection system
	- When selecting a user with protection status, the targeted command buttons will now grey out as they are not usable on these users
	- Fixed an issue where phantom moderation panel windows would remain in the background undeleted, causing a crash on program close
	- Window is no longer resizeable

Logging
	- Small edits to how the internal logging system works

Sound Handler
	- Completely rewritten sound handling
	- Sounds that are set to be play will now be staged
	- Sounds can only play at a minimum of 20ms between each sound
	- This will fix the occasional missed sound caused by the original time buffer that was implemented to fix the crashing problem

Protection System
	- Updates to the function check so that it only queries the web file once, and then keeps it saved in memory
	- This will result in a noticeable performance increase when tabbing through the list of clients in the moderation panel

TargetData Command
	- Newly implemented data command used to target specific users with data packets
	- Utilized only for when a new user joins the TS server to send them your initial data readout
	- This will result in significant performance increase for the plugin as each client no longer has to attempt to process redundant data commands sent by other clients every time a new person joins the server

Info Data Display
	- Update to the info-data display to finally fix the bug where client states do not update when someone enables/disables their plugin/override
	- No longer have to click off and back on to someone’s name to see state changes

Priority 911s
	- New 911 ability, if a civilian double taps their 911 hotkey (with a 500 ms interval between the two button presses) the dispatchers will receive a special priority 911

General Fixes
	- Dispatch alerts (Signal 100, 10-3) have been properly labeled internally and should now function again for other clients
	-No 911 cooldown on the 911 hotkey fixed (Set to 45 seconds)
